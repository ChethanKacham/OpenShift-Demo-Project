# üöÄ OpenShift Demo Project

**OpenShift Demo Project** is a full-stack application built with ReactJS (frontend), NodeJS (backend), and MongoDB (database). This project serves as a prototype to simulate the process of creating a project in OpenShift. While the feature doesn't create projects in OpenShift, it illustrates the architecture and workflow of such functionality.
